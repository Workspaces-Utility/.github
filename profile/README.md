## About Workspaces
Workspaces is a productivity powerhouse designed for anyone who works on multiple projects or switches between different types of tasks throughout the day. It tackles the common problem of digital clutter and context-switching overhead by allowing you to save and restore the exact state of your computer for a given task. Imagine having a dedicated "Writing" workspace that opens Ulysses, your research PDFs, and a calming music playlist, and a separate "Client Project X" workspace that launches Figma, Slack, a specific Finder folder, and the project's Notion page. Workspaces makes this a reality.

The application works by remembering which applications were open, which documents were in use, which Finder windows were active, and even which URLs were loaded in your browser. You can organize these workspaces in the app's sidebar, launch them from the menu bar, or assign keyboard shortcuts for lightning-fast access. By automating your setup routine, Workspaces not only saves precious minutes every day but also helps your brain transition into "focus mode" for a particular task more quickly, as the environment itself cues the correct mental state.
